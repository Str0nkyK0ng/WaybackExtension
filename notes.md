- Set a preference to auto replace / or click to replace
- Indication in the extension icon that a lookup is happening
  - Automatic: Overlayed / added to the page (highlighting any changes. Little UI letting you click forward / backward)
  - See the differences highlighted (literal diff, highlighting, background colors. You can hover and see what it previous was / what it is now)
  - Thinking about how to show multiple versions
- See both versions side by side (would be hard to align though with different CSS(s) and new elements)
- Highlighting changes (specify which color)

## Goal: Highlight diffs (also unbork the project)
